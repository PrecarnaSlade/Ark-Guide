# ..: **ARK : SE** Genesis Part 1 & 2 Missions :..

**THIS GUIDE IS FREE AND WILL REMAIN THAT WAY.**

## ..: Disclaimer :..

Hello dear reader, if you are here it means you are looking for answers regarding completing ARK Genesis missions. Before saying anything, remember that us, ARK players, do not have absolute knowledge about everything. This file aims to be completed by peers and if I'm the one that started it, well it does not mean that I will put the final point.

Let me introduce myself, few people read the disclaimer so I do not expect you to acknowledge this but I think it's more polite. My full nickname is Slade Precarna, I started really playing in 2016 and, with some pauses, I played ever since. I'm not the commonly known 15k+ hours player (I have about 5k across my accounts as of now) but for anyone wandering I think it does not really matters as long as informations written in this document are facts and not hearsay. Do not recommend people to force feed 1 Stimberry then 5 Narcoberry cause apparently the food will go down (that's for all the older player of ARK, we heard this in earlier days). 

I finished all the missions of Genesis multiple times on single players and on different servers vanilla and slightly modded (SS and S+). The footages used in this document are from an S+ french server, I will show my personal equipment later but keep in mind ARK balance team was on a trip during missions creation. Regardless, with all its bugs, glitch and exploits, we love ARK for what it is, we always come back to it and it's always a blast to feel the little dilo on the beach bitting you at the start of a new adventure.

I will not take more of your time, let's get started.

# ..: Prologue - Mission types :.. 

In this section you will find global tips. You don't have to do the same as me ! It's just the way I did the missions. The names are extracted from the [Wiki](https://ark.fandom.com/wiki/Missions_(Genesis:_Part_1)).

I will never talk about score in a mission. This guide is to help you *finish* all the missions, not *speedrun* all the missions.

List of mission types :
- [Hunt](#hunt-missions)
- [Race](#race-missions)
- [Gauntlet](#gauntlet-missions)
- [Checkpoint](#checkpoint-missions)
- [Escort](#escort-missions)
- [Basketball](#basketball-missions)
- [Fishing](#fishing-missions)
- [Retrieve](#retrieve-missions)
- [Boss](#boss-missions)
- [Maze](#maze-missions)

## <u> Hunt missions </u>

In these missions, you have to kill a big version of an existing Dino (Giga Tek in technically in the files so it exists, don't nitpick this example). You follow steps to 2 checkpoints where you gently arm the hunted dino then at the end you have a third encounter when you fight the dino and his escort.

**Always try to use Giga/Carcha for hunt missions**. They can hit behind them which is a wonderful perk in a lot of cases. I would stay away from rexes but like always feel free to experiment.

Summary of what is needed : 
- **Gamma** : Can be done with a freshly tamed Giga/Carcha.
- **Beta** : Can be done with a good imprinted Giga/Carcha.
- **Alpha** : Highly depends on the missions, check individually each mission specific guide.

## <u> Race missions </u>

In these missions, you have to reach a certain place while going through Blue/Yellow circles (Superman 64 style) in a limited amount of time. 
Blue circles are mandatory.

**No tricks only skill**. All of the possible tricks and tips are dino related. I will explain them nonetheless but remember that if you struggle on a specific race while knowing all the tips, you just have to practice. You can do it don't worry.

## <u> Gauntlet missions </u>

In these missions you have to survive 10 waves "without" any dinos nor weapons. You will be able to buy weapons so you will not fight with your fists.

 **There are a way to purchase dinos within the mission on Genesis 2. On Genesis 1, with the help of someone outside the mission, you can make one of your *own* dino enter the arena.** It makes these missions bearable on Alpha. On Genesis 2 look at the guide, this mission required a bit of skill and a lot of preparation.

## <u> Checkpoint missions </u>

In these missions, you have to progress 

## <u> Escort missions </u>

## <u> Basketball missions </u>

## <u> Fishing missions </u>

## <u> Retrieve missions </u>

## <u> Boss missions </u>

 ## <u> Maze missions </u>

In these missions, you have to navigate a VR maze with puzzles and goals to reach. It ends with a boss.

**Exclusive to Genesis 2.** Don't look for them in Genesis 1.

**Lots and lots of tricks in these missions**. The normal way of playing is surely challenging if you don't know what to do but we are here to finish the mission not use the default path. Look at each mission guide, we can all learn new things so feel free to send me strategies and tips to add in here.
